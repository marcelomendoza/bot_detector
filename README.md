# Bot detection in social and interaction networks
Codes from the paper "Bots in social and interaction networks: Detection and impact estimation", authored by M. Mendoza, M. Tesconi and S. Cresci, 2020. 

The proposed algorithms were implemented in Python 3.6. Gensim was used to handle encodings. The index was implemented using MRPT. Numpy was used for vector management. The codes are available here on two Jupiter notebooks:

Bot detection algorithm: in Bot detection-git.ipynb (default representation: social network).

Interaction networks: in Bots and retrofitting-git.ipynb.
